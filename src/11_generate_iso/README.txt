This file is located in directory '11_generate_iso'. You can use this directory
to put your own content (files and folders) which will be visible in the root
directory of your 'Minimal Linux Live' system, just like this file is visible.
The files/folders will override the content in the root folder, so be careful
what you put there because you may end up with broken system. :)
