The easiest way to build "Minimal Linux Live" is to run the following script:

sh build_minimal_linux_live.sh

Note that the build process requires proper toolchain already installed and
configured. Check the project's website for more information:

http://minimal.linux-bg.org

I only provide the build scripts. It's entirely up to you to configure and
prepare your build environment. I use "Linux Mint" both 32 and 64 bit editions.
Your distribution might have different build dependencies but most of the time
there is a single meta-package which installs most of the stuff that you need.

The build proces is slow, so be prepared to wait. In the end you should have
the ISO image file "minimal_linux_live.iso" in the same folder where you
executed the build process. You can burn the ISO image on CD/DVD or (better)
run it with PC emulator like QEMU or VirtualBox.
