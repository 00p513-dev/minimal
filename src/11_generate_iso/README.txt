This file has been generated from directory '11_generate_iso'. You can use this
directory to put your own content (files and folders) which will be visible in
the root directory of your 'Minimal Linux Live' system, just like this file is
visible. The files/folders will override the content in the root folder, so be
careful what you put there because you may end up with broken system. If the
boot media is writeable, then all changes on the root file system are persisted
automatically, so be very careful what you do when you use the overlay support.


Check the file '/src/.config' for more details on the overlay options.
