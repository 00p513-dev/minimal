# Define the overlay type to use. Possible values are 'sparse' and 'folder'. You can use any other
# value, no value, or comment the property in order to disable it. Put your overlay content in the
# folder '11_generate_iso' and it will be automatically merged with the root file system on boot.
# The build process creates either '/minimal.img/rootfs' or '/minimal/rootfs' (read below) and this
# folder contains all overlay content in it. The build process also creates '/minimal.img/work'
# or '/minimal/work'. This folder is used by the overlay driver to store modifications related
# to the read only storage. If the overlay media is writeable, then all changes on
# the root filesystem are automatically persisted and preserved on reboot.
#
# sparse - use sparse file 'minimal.img' with hardcoded maximal size of 1MB (see 11_generate_iso.sh).
#          The generated ISO image is larger because the sparse file is treated as regular file. This
#          option requires root permissions or otherwise sparse file generation is silently skipped.
#          Sparse file is treated as separate disk image and works fine on 'vfat'. 
#
# folder - use normal folder structure (/minimal/). Note that this doesn't work if the file system is
#          'vfat' because FAT requires special handling, e.g. POSIX overlay (http://sf.net/p/posixovl).
#          This is the default option because it doesn't require root permissions.
